## Job Assessment Project

## How to view this project locally
Easy way:
1. Create a folder on your desktop
2. In your browser, go to https://lisherdesigns.com/assessment/
3. Right-click inside the page and select "save as" and save inside your new folder
4. Inside your new folder, double-click the Document.html file. This should open in your browser. 

Using VS Code:
1. Inside VS Code, clone down the repo into a folder.
2. Close VS Code and then open the Golden-Project folder in VS Code.
3. To view in a browser I use an extension called "Live Server" which should display a Go Live button in the lower right corner of VS Code.
