Job Assessment Project

## How to view this project locally
Easy way:
1. Create a folder on your desktop
2. In your browser, go to https://lisherdesigns.com/assessment/
3. Right-click inside the page and select "save as" and save inside your new folder
4. Inside your new folder, double-click the Document.html file. This should open the page in your browser. 

Using VS Code:
1. Inside VS Code, clone down the repo into a folder.
2. Close VS Code and then open the Golden-Project folder in VS Code.
3. To view in a browser use an extension called "Live Server" which should display a Go Live button in the lower right corner of VS Code.

## What to do next?
1. I would start working on the JavaScript so when someone clicks a category button at the top, the coresponding elements below would be hidden. The button would change color to red signifying that it is hidden.
2. I need to add the rest of the category buttons at the top.
3. I need to add the the remaining category content below.
4. At a larger screen width, I think we could have two columns as the paragraphs are too wide for easy reading.
